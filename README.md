# Beers

The **Beers** App is a simple iOS application that displays a list of beers and their details.

The main screen of the app displays a list of beers, each with a picture, name, and short description. Tapping on a beer makes a new view appears. It shows  more information about the beer, including its alcohol content and its description.


## Features

The app is built using SwiftUI and follows the MVVM architectural pattern. It fetches data from the **[Punk API](https://punkapi.com)** asynchronously. The app also includes a search bar, which allow users to search for beers by name. As the user types, the list of beers is dynamically updated to only show beers that match the search query.


üçª **Cheers!**
